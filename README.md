# ArduCopter ROS Teleoperations



**Code**:
 - A brief package written in C++ built for Arducopter.
 - Allows user input instead of a traditional RC transmitter with Mavros underneath


**Quick Start**:
- ROS should be installed, and you first need to create a catkin workspace.
- Make sure that this package is within the `src/` folder of your catkin workspace, and simply do `catkin_make`.
